# 📝 Posters, Posters, Posters!

This is *a collection of all the conference posters* I’ve created over the years.

I’ve been fortunate enough to present my work at several conferences, and each time, I put a lot of effort into making the poster.

Unfortunately, most posters tend to be forgotten just minutes after the session ends… 😅📉

But I’ve decided not to let all that hard work go to waste!

✨ I’m gathering them all in one place so I can look back and see how I’ve grown—both professionally and with a bit of humor, haha! 🌱📈

No -- I have decided that I will not let my hard work go to waste.
Or at least, I'd keep all the posters in one place, so that I can look back and see how I have improved over the years (both professionally and funny side, hahahaa)

Okie~ Let's get started 🚀
